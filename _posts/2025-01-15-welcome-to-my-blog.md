Welcome to my personal blog! I'm Sercan Ceyhan, a water resources engineer and AI/data consultant based in Sacramento, California.

## What to Expect

On this blog, I'll be sharing insights, tutorials, and thoughts on topics including:

- **Water Resources Engineering** — Practical experiences from my work with IWFM, MODFLOW, and integrated hydrological modeling
- **Data Science for Hydrology** — How to apply Python, machine learning, and data analysis to water resources challenges
- **Software Development** — Tools and techniques for building applications that serve water professionals
- **Industry Trends** — The evolving intersection of technology and water resources management

## Why Start a Blog?

After 10+ years in the water resources consulting industry, I've accumulated knowledge and experiences that I believe could benefit others in the field. Whether you're a fellow engineer, a student, or someone interested in the intersection of water and technology, I hope you'll find something useful here.

## Stay Connected
