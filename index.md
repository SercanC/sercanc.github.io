## About Me

I am a water resources engineer with 10+ years of consulting experience and a background in integrated hydrological modeling at regional and watershed scales, water budget development, and hydrologic data analysis. I have developed several IWFM and MODFLOW applications and contributed to the development and maintenance of many others across California.

I received my BSc in Environmental Engineering from Middle East Technical University (Turkey), my MSc in Water Resources Engineering and Management from University of Stuttgart (Germany), and my PhD in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of California, Davis.

Currently, I serve as a Technical Manager at [Woodard & Curran](https://www.woodardcurran.com/) in Sacramento. I also founded [Elevate Processes LLC](https://elevatepro.ai), where I provide AI and data consulting services.

My passion lies at the convergence of traditional water resource engineering and cutting-edge technology. I thrive on data analysis, numerical models, programming, GIS tools, and machine learning applications. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of innovation and technology in water resources modeling, and I'm always looking for opportunities to leverage my skills to advance water planning and management practices.
