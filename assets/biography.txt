Biography 
I am a water resources engineer with 10+ years of consulting experience and a background in integrated hydrological modeling at regional or watershed scales, water budget development and hydrologic data analysis. I have developed several IWFM and MODFLOW applications and contributed to the development and maintenance of many others across California. 

I received my BSc degree in Environmental Engineering from the Middle East Technical University, Turkey, my MSc degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management from University of Stuttgart, Germany and my Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of California - Davis. I joined Woodard & Curran in 2018, and currently serving as a Technical Manager in their Sacramento office.

My passion lies in the convergence of traditional water resource engineering and cutting-edge technology. I thrive on data analysis, numerical models, programming, GIS tools, and machine learning applications. I'm particularly interested in the exciting intersection of innovation and technology in water resources modeling. I'm on the lookout for opportunities where I can leverage my skills and experience to serve the community by advancing our water planning and management practices.
